## üÜï Suggested New Tasks for Next Evolution Phase

Based on the current fully functional system, here are 6 recommended new tasks:

### **High Priority (3 tasks)**

#### **TEL-17: Production Monitoring Dashboard Enhancement**
- **Description:** Web-based dashboard for VPS metrics, agent analytics, system health visualization
- **Priority:** High
- **Justification:** Current Telegram monitoring works but lacks detailed analytics interface

#### **TEL-18: Agent Execution History and Performance Analytics**
- **Description:** Comprehensive analytics for agent performance, success rates, optimization insights
- **Priority:** High  
- **Justification:** System is operational but lacks performance metrics for optimization

#### **TEL-19: Advanced Error Recovery and Retry Logic**
- **Description:** Sophisticated error recovery with automatic retry strategies and smart failure handling
- **Priority:** High
- **Justification:** Production system needs robust error handling for enterprise use

### **Medium Priority (2 tasks)**

#### **TEL-20: Multi-User Support and Team Collaboration**  
- **Description:** Scale beyond single user with team workspaces and permission-based access
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Justification:** Natural evolution for broader adoption

#### **TEL-21: Resource Usage Optimization and Limits**
- **Description:** Intelligent resource monitoring, dynamic scaling, VPS optimization
